Instantiation
=============

``MyList`` can be instantiated with no arguments, which will return
an empty list:

::
    >>> write_file = __import__('1-write_file').write_file

    >>> nb_characters = write_file("my_first_file.txt", "This School is so cool!\n")
    >>> print(nb_characters)
    29


Compare with new list of filenames


::

    >>> list = ["my_second_file.txt", "my_tree_file.txt", "my_four_file.txt" ]
    >>> nb_characters = write_file(list, "This is the new probe")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
        File "/home/dkb4rb/Documentos/HOLBERTON/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/0x0B-python-input_output/1-write_file.py", line 9, in write_file
            with open(filename, 'w') as file:
    TypeError: expected str, bytes or os.PathLike object, not list


in reverse of the moment pass of the argumentsto function

::


    >>> list = ["my_second_file.txt", "my_tree_file.txt", "my_four_file.txt" ]
    >>> nb_characters = write_file(list, "This is the new probe")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
        File "/home/dkb4rb/Documentos/HOLBERTON/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/0x0B-python-input_output/1-write_file.py", line 9, in write_file
            with open(filename, 'w') as file:

    >>> list = ["my_second_file.txt", "my_tree_file.txt", "my_four_file.txt" ]
    >>> nb_characters = write_file("my_first_file.txt", "This School is so cool!\n" + list)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "list") to str



::


    >>> nb_characters = write_file("my_first_file.txt", list)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
        File "/home/dkb4rb/Documentos/HOLBERTON/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/0x0B-python-input_output/1-write_file.py", line 10, in write_file
            file.write(text)
    TypeError: write() argument must be str, not list


::


    >>> nb_characters = write_file("my_first_file.txt", 1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
        File "/home/dkb4rb/Documentos/HOLBERTON/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/0x0B-python-input_output/1-write_file.py", line 10, in write_file
            file.write(text)
    TypeError: write() argument must be str, not int


This error is true to moment to pass one integer for writing in to ```my_first_file```
